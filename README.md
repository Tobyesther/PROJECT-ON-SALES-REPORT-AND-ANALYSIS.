# PROJECT-ON-SALES-REPORT-AND-ANALYSIS.

 âšœ**INTRODUCTION**

- This Project was given from the 3rd Cohort Data Analysis Class by Promise Chinonso. It entails a dataset of 21 column and 9995 rows being created from the U.S Superstore and we are to generate questions based on this data given in order to create a business informed decision for the Manager at the U.S Superstore regarding his business problems and give pointers on areas of improvement and attention.

âšœ**QUESTION/POINTER'S**

Regarding the dataset we are considering and the problem we are tackling, a set of 9 questions were generated to help solve and make better informed decisions in the coming year. The questions generated are:

- 1.	What is the total sales and profit for each segment.					
- 2.  What was the total profit generated for each region and which region had the highest profit					
- 3.	What state has the highest and lowest sales revenue					
- 4.	Which product category had the highest sales and highest sales quantity.					
- 5.	Analyze the sale trends from 2014 - 2017 and the determine the year with the highest profit.					
- 6.	Which region had the highest shipment.					
- 7.	Determine the average order quantity and average profit for each shipping mode.					
- 8.	Calculate the average profit per quarter from year 2014- 2017.				
- 9.	Which month recorded the highest and lowest sales and Profit from 2014 - 2017.





 âšœ**FUNCTIONALITIES**

 - PIVOT TABLE
 - PIVOT CHART
 - MAX AND MIN FUNCTION





ðŸ”·**QUESTION 1**

The total sales and Profit for each segment was necessary to calculate because these segments make up the different unit controlling the sales of all the differnt products at the store. The total sales and profit was generated using the Pivot table, by highlighting the data sheet and clicking on 'Insert' and the Pivot table, and generating a new worsheet. On this new worksheet, a dialogue box containing all the variables highlighted in the data sheet, then i moved the segment column to the 'Row' box and the sales and profit column to the value and column box. This gave a display of the total sales and profit generated by each segment at the Superstore.

ðŸ”·**QUESTION 2**

The total profit generated for each region was calculated following the same process in question 1, but here, the region column was moved to the 'Row' box while the profit column was moved to the 'Value' box giving the total profit made across the four regions; Central, East, South and West. From the calculation, the West region recorded the highest profit while the Central region had the lowest profit indicating that more attention should be focused on the central region in the coming year in order to increase profit.

-----------------







ðŸ”·**QUESTION 3**

I narrowed the problem down to the state to pinpoint what state was doing well and what state was not doing well in terms of sales. This was calculated similar to the above method. Here, the state column was moved to the 'Row' box while the Sales column was moved to the 'Value' box. From the result gotten, I calculated the state with the highest and lowest sales value using the 'MAX' and 'MIN' function, i.e =MAX(C34:82) and =MIN(C34:82). From the result, California had the highest sale and it was highlighted in green while North Darkota had the lowest sale, highlighted in yellow.

-----------------








ðŸ”·**QUESTION 4**

I also narrowed the problem to finding Which product category had the highest sales and highest sales quantity. This was calculated using pivot table as explained above. Here, the Category for product was moved to the 'Row' column while the sales and quantity column was moved to the 'Value' box and 'Column' box respectively. From the result gotten, Technolgy has the higest sales while Office Supplies had the highest quantity supplied.

---------------------







ðŸ”·**QUESTION 5**

I went further to analyze the sale trends from 2014 - 2017 and the determine the year with the highest profit. By calculating for this, i wanted to know if there was a steady increase in sales as the year passes. This was also calculated using the same process. I had to generate the year column first because the year wasn't included in the original data set provided. This was gotten by using the Year function and the order date column, i.e =Year(C2:C9995). After generating the year column, i went ahead to create my pivot table just like the same process expalained above and moved the year column to the 'Row' box and the Sales column to the 'Value' column. Overall, there was steady increase in sales as the year progresses but there was a slight decrease in sales between 2014 and 2015.

ðŸ”·**QUESTION 6**

Narrowing it down to the shipping, i calculated Which region had the highest shipment using pivot table and the same process. I moved the region column to the Row box and the Shipping date column to the value box to count the number of shipment to each region. The West region had the highest number of shipment.

-----------------------------








ðŸ”·**QUESTION 7**

Still on Shipping, i tried to determine the average order quantity and average profit for each shipping mode. This was calculated by moving the Shipping mode column to the Row box and the quantity column and profit colum to the Value box and Column box respectively. This gave us the sum of each variable, so in order to calculate for the average, i double clicked on sum of quantity and profit column to change the function to 'Average' giving us the average values for the differnt shipping mode. The result showed no much difference in the average quantity across the shiping mode while the first class shipping made the highest profit among the shipping mode.

------------------







ðŸ”·**QUESTION 8**

I also went ahead to Calculate the average profit per quarter from year 2014- 2017. By moving the year column to the Row box and then selecting the quarter from the sub-section of the year column in the Pivot table. This showed a steady increase in the first quarter from 2014 - 2017 while other quarters experienced an increase and decrease as the year progresses.

----------------------------






ðŸ”·**QUESTION 9**

After calculating for the year and quarter, i narrowed it down to the month to determine Which month recorded the highest and lowest sales and Profit from 2014 - 2017. I first generated a month Column using the Month function and the order date column, i.e =Month(C2:C9995).After this, using the pivot table, i moved the month column to the Row box and the sales and profit column to the Value box and column box respectively. From the result, there was an obvious increase in sales as the month goes by, leading to a steady increase in profit also with December recording the highest number of sales and profit.

âšœ**CONCLUSION**

- This project depicts areas where attention should be shifted to and worked on, ranging from the region to the state, segment and product. This can be achieved through promotion of the products by adverts on Social media, the media, billboards, Campaigns, voluntary outreach etc.
